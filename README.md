# QPSK-pi-4-QPSK-MSK

In this project we compare the 
performance of QPSK, ùúã/4 QPSK and MSK modulation schemes for the AWGN. we randomly produced a stream of 0s and 1s. After the 
string is modulatedand, it will be passed through the channel


# QPSK in AWGN channel
 we can use  qpsk library in MATLAB to create  +1,-1,+i,-i 
 here is the output:
