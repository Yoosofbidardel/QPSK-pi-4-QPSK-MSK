# QPSK-pi-4-QPSK-MSK

In this project we compare the 
performance of QPSK, 𝜋/4 QPSK and MSK modulation schemes for the AWGN. we randomly produced a stream of 0s and 1s. After the 
string is modulatedand, it will be passed through the channel


# QPSK in AWGN channel
 we can use  qpsk library in MATLAB to create  +1,-1,+i,-i 
 here is the output for different SNRs:

# 𝜋/4 QPSK:
for creating this we used 2 QPSK modulatior with 0 and 45 degree shifts respectivelty, then we combined these in order to have a 𝜋/4 QPSK
here is the output for different SNRs:
